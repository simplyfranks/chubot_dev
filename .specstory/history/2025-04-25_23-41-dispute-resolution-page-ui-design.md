# Dispute Resolution Page UI Design (2025-04-26 00:41:12)

_**User**_

i want to create the dispute resolution page, you will handle the ui here as well, you can also check the flow of the ui in the app and create this page. Dispute resolution maybe like customer support but i believe it should handle more strict request, I believe... So please just suggest the appropriate ui for this

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a dispute resolution page for your app. Let me first examine the app structure to understand its design patterns and flow.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory lib • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `main.dart` |
| 📁 `features` |
| 📁 `core` |
| 📁 `data` |

</details>

---

Let's look at the app's features to understand the structure better:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory lib/features • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `landing` |
| 📁 `splash` |
| 📄 `privacypolicy.dart` |
| 📁 `authentication` |

</details>

---

Let's check the landing directory that contains our profile tab:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory lib/features/landing/profileTab • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `dispute_resolution.dart` |
| 📄 `customer_support.dart` |
| 📄 `profilePage.dart` |
| 📄 `transaction_history.dart` |
| 📄 `payment_methods.dart` |
| 📄 `user_security.dart` |
| 📄 `userDetails.dart` |

</details>

---

Now let's examine the customer support page to understand the UI patterns since dispute resolution might be similar:

---

Read file: lib/features/landing/profileTab/customer_support.dart

---

Let's also look at the profile page to understand the navigation and UI patterns:

---

Read file: lib/features/landing/profileTab/profilePage.dart

---

Let's also check for any design constants or color schemes:

---

Read file: lib/core/constants/colors.dart

---

Now that I have a better understanding of the app's structure and design patterns, I'll create the dispute resolution page:
