I'll help you modify the privacy policy page to add PDF download functionality. We'll need to:
1. Create a PDF version of the privacy policy
2. Add functionality to download and save the PDF

First, let's add the required dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file. I'll search for it first.

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "pubspec.yaml" â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

Let me check the current dependencies:


---

Read file: pubspec.yaml

Now I'll add the necessary dependencies and modify the privacy policy page to include PDF functionality. We'll need to add:
1. `pdf` package for creating PDFs
2. `path_provider` (already present) for file operations
3. `share_plus` for sharing the PDF

Let me edit the pubspec.yaml first:


---

```diff
    camera: ^0.11.1
    image_cropper: ^9.1.0
+   pdf: ^3.10.7
+   share_plus: ^7.2.1
  
  dev_dependencies:
```

Now, let's modify the privacy.dart file to add PDF generation and download functionality:
